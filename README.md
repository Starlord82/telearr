   - Type `/newbot` and follow the prompts:
     - Choose a name (e.g., `TeleArrBot`)
     - Choose a username (must end in `bot`, e.g., `telearr_notifier_bot`)
   - BotFather will give you a **bot token** (looks like: `123456789:ABCdefGhIJKlmnoPQrstuvWXyz`)

2. **Get Your Chat ID:**
   - Start a conversation with your bot by clicking its Telegram link and sending any message
   - Visit this URL in your browser (replace `<TOKEN>` with your bot token):
     ```
     https://api.telegram.org/bot<TOKEN>/getUpdates
     ```
   - Look for `"chat":{"id":123456789,...}` ‚Äî that number is your **Chat ID**
